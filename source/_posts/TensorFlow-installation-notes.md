I just wrote some installation notes for install TensorFlow 1.4 on Ubuntu 17.10

[TensorFlow setup note](https://github.com/team6612/machine-learning-study/tree/master/tensorflow-setup-note)

I may mess up something before I install CUDA 8 and cuDNN 6, so if the installation won't work on a newly installed Ubuntu, please tell me.
